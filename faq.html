			        <p><b>Storj</b> (pronounced: storage) aims to become a cloud storage platform that can’t be censored or monitored, or have downtime. It is the first decentralized, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage that uses blockchain technology and cryptography to secure your files.</p>

				        <p>Storj is a platform, cryptocurrency, and suite of decentralized applications that allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Your files are encrypted, shredded into little pieces called 'shards', and stored in a decentralized network of computers around the globe. No one but you has a complete copy of your file, not even in an ecrypted form.</p>

				        <p>Because of this, Storj can be faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional cloud storage platforms. Faster because multiple machines are serving you your file simultaneously, cheaper because you are renting people's spare hard-drive space instead of paying for a purpose-built data center, and more secure because your file is both encrypted and shredded. There is no need to trust a corporation, vulnerable servers, or employees with your files. Storj completely removes trust from the equation.</p>

				        <p>Storj uses blockchain features like a transaction ledger, public/private key encryption, and cryptographic hash functions for security.</p>

					<p>Storj is working hard to solve data security issues with the help of its own web app, <a href="https://app.storj.io/" class="link">Storj</a>, which lets you store your files, and client app, <a href="https://storj.io/share.html" class="link">Storj Share</a>, which lets you rent your hard-drive space for money.</p>

					<p>To best protect your data, files are encrypted client-side on your computer before they are uploaded. Each file is split up into chunks which are first encrypted and then distributed for storage across the Storj network. The network is comprised of Storj Share nodes run by users around the world who rent out their unused hard drive space in return for <b>Storjcoin X (SJCX)</b>.</p>

					<p>The decentralized aspect of Storj means there are no central servers to be compromised, and with client-side encryption, your are in control of the keys to your files.</p>

			        <p>Storj is a cloud storage platform. The key word in that sentence is ‘platform’ because without it, Storj would just really be a decentralized cloud storage alternative. While a decentralized cloud storage alternative in itself would still be a great product, what we are creating goes beyond that.</p>

					<p>Storj allows users to create decentralized applications. We have already begun to see basic demos using the Storj API and pulling content from the network, including an image viewer, a .txt and .pdf viewer, a music player, and even a video service. Some of these services have even been thrown into a Storj Media Center of sorts.</p>

					<p>Our corporate entity Storj Labs aims to bring decentralized cloud storage to the average business and consumer. With constant data breaches and high costs, users are becoming more aware that the current model of cloud storage is broken. Storj Labs provides DaaS (Data-as-a-Service), as well as help building tools and APIs for customers to be able to interface with this new cloud storage model.</p>

			        <p>Drive Farming is the term we use to describe the renting out extra hard drive space. This is comparable to traditional crypto-currency mining; in the same way you can use your computer's processor to mine Bitcoin, you can use the hard drive space to farm SJCX. Users allocate a portion of their available hard drive space and specify a folder on their drive to store network data.</p>
			        <p>This space stores small encrypted shards of Storj users’ files. This means that no farmer holds the entire file that a user uploaded, and because the file is encrypted, it's unlikely that the farmer could read it anyway.</p>
			        <p>If someone attempts to access and alter the files that they are storing, the shard will fail the next challenge issued by the owner of the data. This will result in the malicious node being dropped, and the network will select another location to store the shard. And of course, the network doesn’t pay cheating nodes.</p>
			        <p>The simple Storj Share GUI will allow you to specify how much storage space you want to share, add an SJCX address for payments, and specify a Storj node to use.</p>
			        <p>Then, when people upload files via Storj, if your node is online, you will start getting file chunks hosted on your drive and you will get a reward for them.</p>
					<p>There are a few variables that could make the number of hosted chunks on your shared storage (and thus your expected rewards) higher or lower:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Size of shared storage</p></li>
						<li><p>Upload and download bandwidth</p></li>
						<li><p>Reliability and availability of your Storj Share node</p></li>

			        <p>Because Storj provides secure zero-knowledge encrypted storage, it's almost impossible to know what type of data is being stored. However third-party service providers, developers, and apps wishing to utilize the Storj network can restrict the types of files and uploads that maybe stored on the network through their front-end.</p>

			        <p>No. To protect against node failures and downtime the Storj network defaults to three redundant storage nodes. If you manually lowered the number of nodes storing their files to a single node, then your file would be inaccessible until it came back online.</p>
			        <p>Also, if your files are stored with multiple nodes and one goes offline, the Storj network will automatically find another node to take over the open contract so your files continue to be available.</p>

				      <p>In order to hold your SJCX, you need to store them in a Counterparty compatible address to which you hold the private key yourself. Several options are available: The original Counterparty web-wallet is available at <a href="http://counterwallet.io" target="_blank" class="link">http://counterwallet.io</a>. For mobile users, there is the IndieSquare HD wallet with built-in Decentralized Exchange (DEX) which you can download for iOS or android at <a href="http://wallet.indiesquare.me" target="_blank" class="link">http://wallet.indiesquare.me</a>.</p>
				      <p>Regardless of the option you choose, you can access your tokens with the same passphrase in any of the available wallets. So if one of them is down for some reason, you can still access your tokens with one of the other options. If you are worried about the security of third party and online wallets, you can always store your SJCX using Armory cold storage. Since Storjcoin X (SJCX) is a Counterparty token it can be stored on any BTC address. However, it is very important that you only send SJCX to a BTC address of which you hold the private key yourself.</p>
				      <p>The following Armory example works with other wallets as well. <a href="http://blog.pryds.eu/2014/09/how-to-keep-your-sjcx-in-cold-storage.html" target="_blank" class="link">Offline signing of a SJCX transaction</a> - If your wallet doesn’t support offline signing you can still <a href="http://blog.pryds.eu/2014/07/store-your-sjcx-in-armory.html" target="_blank" class="link">import your private key</a> (however your private key will not be secret anymore so don’t use that BTC address again).</p>

			          Why Storjcoin X? Why not just use Bitcoin as form of payment on the network?

			    <div id="collapse-6-6" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="faq-6-6">
			      <div class="panel-body">
			        <p>Many users coming from the Bitcoin space ask us why we created a new token named Storjcoin X (“SJCX”). There is a mix of technical and economic reasons why we felt a new token was needed. SJCX is built with Counterparty, which uses the Bitcoin blockchain. We have plans to implement Bitcoin in the future when Storj is more stable (ideally using sidechains).</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><p><b>Bitcoin is too Expensive</b> - For standard storage providers 1 GB of storage goes $0.03 per month. So what if I want to store 1 MB and do payments every hour? Each payment would be $0.000000042. One satoshi, as of time of writing, is worth $0.0000037. This means Bitcoin would place some economic restrictions on the network.</p></li>
                      <li><p><b>Micropayment Lockup</b> - We plan on using micropayment channels, which require locking up coins on the blockchain for the duration of the channel. We would much rather lock up lots of SJCX, than hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin while we’re still testing the protocol.</p></li>
                      <li><p><b>Economic Isolation</b> - Bitcoin price fluctuates heavily for a wide variety of factors. Currency volatility can directly impact the profitability of nodes, and cause problems for the network. Having a separate token that is transacted widely within the network, but has little interaction outside the network, more directly ties currency price to network health.</p></li>

			        <p>It's very hard to associate a shard with its decrypted content without the decryption key. Because the user is in control of the keys, content that is private will tend to stay private. When a user distributes the download information and the keys online they are giving up the privacy of their content by letting the public access it and decrypt it.</p>
					<p>Calculating the hash of a file in no way lets you determine the content of the file. If a farmer only has a small chunk of an encrypted file, then even if he had the keys he would still need to know about and collect all the other chunks before being able to read the content of the file.</p>
					<p>So users can store anything they want in private, and potentially distribute it to people they trust, but as soon as a shard's content is made public, it can be greylisted.</p>

			        <p>Some people may be wary of allowing obscene or violent content to be hosted or distributed through their nodes. Some people have to realize that there needs to be a shift in belief on all sides for us to make widespread use of decentralized tools a reality. There are institutions and organizations that have only ever known and felt comfortable with top-down, centralized methods of enforcement or management. What we're offering is a completely decentralized way for folks to be empowered and follow their own ethics and beliefs. If you disempower people entirely, they may become afraid and try to lash out with centralized hammers (e.g. outright bans, etc.). </p>
			        <p>We have to realize that not everyone in the public, etc. share our beliefs and you could imagine that the MSM could easily paint a picture that the network allows terrorist, CP people, etc. to share with impunity and ease. Those kinds of things are like a dare to regulators, and then basically you leave it to them to try and come up with ways to stop what they think is wrong. They usually don't care as much about decentralization, so their "solutions" are usually broad and heavy. It also creates an "us vs. them" mentality. By coming up with a decentralized solution that doesn't violate the values of the project, it helps people with different beliefs feel more comfortable</p>

			        <p>Because graylist subscriptions will be distributed and managed by peers, can change over time, and are only relevant when file shard contracts are declined, it is impossible to verify that a given node subscribes to any graylist. A node could hypothetically broadcast what graylists it subscribes to, but given the decentralized nature of the network, there's no guarantee that that information would be accurate.</p>
					<p>There is no singular greylist. There will be many graylists with different content categories.</p>
					<p>At the end of the day users will be providing a service, and they get to choose what service they provide. They could follow US law and collect their fees. But perhaps someone in a jurisdiction with more relaxed laws, such as Switzerland, will open up their gateway nodes to any content. Users will be able to control their nodes as they feel more comfortable with. If AirBNB for your hard drive is an apt analogy, someone may not want to accept a drunken junkie into their home. But they are more than welcome to. So why force them to do it?</p>
