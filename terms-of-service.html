                reference. If you do not agree to these Storage Terms, you may not access or use our Storage
                Services. The term &ldquo;<b>Storage Services</b>&rdquo; refers to the websites, mobile
                applications and other online services of Company that you may use to access and use the Storage
                Platform.
              </p>
              <p>You and Company agree as follows:</p>

              <p><b>1. Storj Labs Terms of Use</b></p>

              <p>These Storage Terms incorporate by reference and supplement the <a target="_blank" href="https://storj.io/terms-of-use.html" class="link">Storj Labs Terms of Use</a>. The Storj Labs Terms of Use govern all access to and use of the Services,

                Use in connection with your access and use of the Services (including the Storage Services). The
                Storj Labs Terms of Use and these Storage Terms are collectively referred to as
                the &ldquo;<b>Agreement</b>.&rdquo; PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU READ THE STORJ LABS TERMS OF USE
                CAREFULLY. THEY CONTAIN LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMERS AND A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND

              </p>

              <p><b>2. Overview of Storage Platform</b></p>

              <p>The Storage Services enable you to store data and other materials (&ldquo;<b>Storage Materials</b>&rdquo;)
                via a distributed network of third-party devices (&ldquo;<b>Storage Nodes</b>&rdquo;) that comprise the
                Storage Platform. The Storage Platform is an interconnected set of Storage Nodes that
                independently operate open source software to facilitate the storage of your Storage Materials. The
                Storage Services are designed to encrypt Storage Materials locally on your device and then facilitate
                the distribution of such encrypted data fragments to the Storage Nodes. The Storage Platform and
                Storage Nodes are not operated or maintained by Company, and Company has no responsibility or liability
                for the Storage Platform or Storage Nodes. The Storage Services enable you to protect against loss
                of your Storage Materials due to the failure of any individual Storage Node by allowing you to configure
                the redundancy and distribution of your Storage Materials. You are solely responsible for your use
                of the Storage Platform, including for configurations that you deem appropriate to maintain access to
                your Storage Materials in a manner that meets your expectations.
              </p>

              <p><b>3. Account</b></p>

              <p>In order to use the Storage Services, you will need to register for an account (&ldquo;<b>Account</b>&rdquo;).
                In connection with your creation of any Account, you will (i) provide accurate, current and
                complete Account information, (ii) maintain and promptly update your Account information as necessary,
                (iii) maintain the security of your Account, including by not using the same password for the Storage
                Services that you use for third-party services, (iv) not disclose your password or private keys to any
                third party, and (v) immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any unauthorized
                activities in connection with your Account or the Storage Services. You acknowledge and agree that
                if you lose your private keys, you may not be able to recover any Storage Materials.
              </p>

              <p><b>4. Payment</b></p>

              <p>(a) We will provide notice via the Storage Services of the fees applicable to use of the Storage Services
                (&quot;<b>Fees</b>&quot;). All Fees are exclusive of any applicable taxes, unless stated
                otherwise, which are your sole responsibility. We will provide notice at least 30 days in advance
                of any increase to the Fees.
              </p>
              <p>(b)<b></b>Except where otherwise indicated via the Storage Services, we will charge all Fees to a
                payment method designated by you via the Storage Services that is acceptable to us. You represent
                and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you designate via the Storage Services and
                authorize us to charge all Fees to that method. If your payment method cannot be verified, is
                invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your right to use the Storage Services may be suspended
                automatically. Fees will be charged on a monthly basis based on the prior month&rsquo;s usage.
                You can avoid incurring Fees at any time by discontinuing your use of the Storage Services to
                store your Storage Materials.
              </p>
              <p>(c) Except as prohibited by law, we may assess a late charge if you do not pay Fees on time. The late
                charge will be the lesser of 1.5 % of the unpaid amount each month or the maximum rate permitted by law.
                You are responsible for all costs we incur to collect any past due amounts, including reasonable
                attorneys&#39; fees and other legal fees and costs. We may suspend your access to the Storage Services
                immediately without notice if you fail to pay Fees on time.
              </p>

              <p><b>5. Storage Materials</b></p>

              <p>(a) You grant Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable and
                fully sublicenseable right to reproduce, modify, distribute, and export any Storage Materials solely as
                necessary to comply with your instructions to store such Storage Materials via the Storage Platform.
                This gives us the rights we need to store and retrieve your Storage Materials as you direct us to.
              </p>
              <p>(b) Company will not be responsible for any loss, misuse, or deletion of Storage Materials or any failure
                of any Storage Materials to be stored or encrypted. You are solely responsible for backing up any
                Storage Materials.<b> </b></p>
              <p>(c) You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Storage Services to store your Storage
                Materials via the Storage Platform, and for maintaining appropriate security of your Storage Materials,
                which may include the use of encryption. We reserve the right at any time, without notice, to
                remove, reject or delete any Storage Materials that contain plain text data or otherwise violate the
                terms of this Agreement (including the <a target="_blank" href="https://storj.io/terms-of-use.html" class="link">Storj Labs Terms of Use</a> relating to
                User Content). </p>
              <p>(d) You are solely responsible for ensuring that any processing of Storage Materials via the Storage
                Services is in compliance with all applicable laws. We make no representations or warranties
                regarding the suitability of the Storage Services for the processing of any particular types of data.
                You will provide all notices to, and obtain any consents from, third parties as required by
                applicable law in connection with the processing of Storage Materials via the Storage Services. You
                must not process any Storage Materials that include sensitive data that require heightened security
                protections, including any (i) &ldquo;protected health information,&rdquo;
                as defined under HIPAA, (ii) &ldquo;cardholder data,&rdquo; as defined by the PCI DSS, or (iii) &ldquo;Sensitive
                Personal Data&rdquo;
                as defined under the EU Directive 95/46/EC as enacted in the member states of the European Union.</p>

              <p><b>6. Effect of Suspension or Termination</b></p>

              <p>If your access to the Storage Services is suspended or terminated, you will no longer have access to the
                Storage Materials processed via the Storage Services for storage in the Storage Platform, and your
                Storage Materials may not be recoverable.  If we terminate or suspend your access to the Storage
                Services for reasons other than your breach of the Agreement, we will make commercially reasonable
                efforts to provide you an opportunity to retrieve your Storage Materials via the Storage Services.
              </p>

              <p><b>7. SLA</b></p>

              <p>(a) Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the following service level commitment (&ldquo;<b>SLA</b>&rdquo;):
                except for scheduled maintenance, our Storage Services will be available 99.99999% of the time. We
                calculate availability based upon the service records we maintain. We will use reasonable efforts
                to notify you in advance of any scheduled maintenance.
              </p>
              <p>(b) Our SLA obligations do not extend to any unavailability of the Storage Services that is caused by:
                (i) any hardware or software that you use in connection with the Storage Services; (ii) misuse of our
                Storage Services or the Storage Platform, including use in breach of the Agreement or use other than in
                accordance with any documentation or other instructions provided by Company; (iii) circumstances or
                events beyond the reasonable control of Company; or (iv) our suspension or termination of your access to
                the Storage Services pursuant to the rights we have reserved under the Agreement.
              </p>
              <p>(c) As the sole and exclusive remedy for our breach of the SLA, Company will provide a credit against
                Fees payable to Company (&ldquo;<b>Credits</b>&rdquo;) in the following amounts: (i) if availability
                during any calendar month is less than 99.99999% but above 99.0%, then we will provide a Credit of 10%
                of the monthly Fees actually paid during that month; and (ii) if availability during any calendar month
                is less than 99.0%, then we will provide a Credit of 20% of the monthly Fees actually paid during that
                month.
              </p>
              <p>(d) You will only be eligible to receive Credits if you have paid all Fees on time, are not past due on
                any payments, and notify us of a request for Credits within 30 days of the end of the calendar month in
                which we have not met our SLA. We will issue Credits solely as an offset against future Fees that
                are payable by you to Company. You will not be entitled to a refund or other payment from Company
                in connection with any Credits you accrue. In no event will the total amount of Credits exceed 20%
                of the Fees payable by you for the corresponding month.
              </p>

              <p><b>8. Promotional Credits</b></p>

              <p>(a) The Company may also provide credits against fees payable to the company in relation to marketing, referrals, or other events ("Promotional Credits"). All credits not deemed to be Service Credits will be considered Promotional Credits.
              </p>
              <p>(b) Promotional Credits must be redeemed within 12 months of issuance unless otherwise stated.
              </p>
              <p>(c) After redemption, Promotional Credits are valid for a period of 12 months. Promotional Credits that have not been used at that time will expire.
              </p>
              <p>(d) Promotional offers expressed in Gigabytes of storage or bandwidth will be treated as Promotional Credits in dollar equivalents. For example, a promotional offer of "50 GB free bandwidth" will be reflected on the account statement by a Promotional Credit of $2.50 (50GB bandwidth * $0.05 per GB).
