    				<p><b>16. Release</b></p>

    				<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release Company and the other Company Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties.  <b>You expressly waive any rights you may have under California Civil Code § 1542 as well as any other statute or common law principles that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</b></p>

    				<p><b>17. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</b></p>

    				<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH COMPANY AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>

    				<p><b>17.1. Binding Arbitration</b></p>

    				<p>Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Company (a) waive your and Company’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to this Agreement or the Services resolved in a court, and (b) waive your and Company’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Company will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p>

    				<p><b>17.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</b></p>

    				<p>Any Dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Services is personal to you and Company and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>

    				<p><b>17.3. Federal Arbitration Act</b></p>

    				<p>This Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 17 will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “<b>FAA</b>”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

    				<p><b>17.4. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</b></p>

    				<p>Each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Company will be sent by e-mail to Company at <a href="mailto:hello@storj.io" class="link">hello@storj.io</a>. Notice to you will be by email to the then-current email address in your Account.  Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 17, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 17.1, file a claim in court. </p>

    				<p><b>17.5. Process</b></p>

    				<p>Any arbitration will occur in New Castle County, Delaware.  Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“<b>JAMS</b>”), which are hereby incorporated by reference.  The state and federal courts located in New Castle County, Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.  You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court. </p>

    				<p><b>17.6. Authority of Arbitrator</b></p>

    				<p>As limited by the FAA, this Agreement and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>

    				<p><b>17.7. Rules of JAMS</b></p>

    				<p>The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/" class="link">JAMS website</a>. By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>

    				<p><b>18. Governing Law and Venue</b></p>

    				<p>This Agreement and your access to and use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the parties arising out or relating to this Agreement that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware and the United States, respectively, sitting in New Castle County, Delaware. </p>

    				<p><b>19. Severability</b></p>

    				<p>If any term, clause or provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of this Agreement.</p>

    				<p><b>20. Termination or Suspension</b></p>

    				<p>Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate this Agreement or suspend your right to access the Services.  You may terminate this Agreement without notice by discontinuing use of the Services.  All rights and licenses granted to you under this Agreement will immediately be revoked upon our termination of the Agreement or our suspension of your access to the Services, and you must immediately submit payment for any fees payable to Company under the Agreement (as specified in the Storage Terms).  </p>

    				<p><b>21. Amendment</b></p>

    				<p>We reserve the right to change the terms of this Agreement from time to time in our sole discretion.  If we make changes to the Agreement, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by posting the revised Agreement terms to the Services and updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms and the Storage Terms.  Your continued use of the Services will confirm your acceptance of the revised Agreement.  If you do not agree to the modified Agreement, you must stop using the Services.</p>

    				<p><b>22. Survival</b></p>

    				<p>The following sections will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms: all defined terms and Sections 11 - 19, 22 and 23.</p>

    				<p><b>23. Miscellaneous</b></p>

    				<p>The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Company relating to your access to and use of our Services. We may assign our rights and obligations under the Agreement. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.  We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under the Agreement where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control.  Except as otherwise provided in herein, the Agreement is intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
