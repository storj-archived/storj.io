            <p>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU READ THESE STORAGE SHARING TERMS CAREFULLY. NOTE THAT SECTION 15 CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</p>
            <p>By installing the Software (defined below), you agree to be bound by these Storage Sharing Terms and all terms incorporated by reference.</p>
            <p>Storj Labs Inc. (“<strong>Company</strong>”) provides online storage services (“<strong>Storage Services</strong>”) to its users that enable users to store data and other materials (“<strong>Storage Materials</strong>”) via a distributed network of independently operated devices (“<strong>Devices</strong>”). Each Device communicates with the Storage Services via open source software (“<strong>Software</strong>”) that is installed on the Device. The Software enables a Device to rent extra storage space (“<strong>Space</strong>”) available on the Device to Company or directly to other third parties. Company may use the Space it rents from you or may re-rent the Space it rents from you to other users via the Storage Services.</p>
            <p>These Storage Sharing Terms provide the terms pursuant to which you may rent Space to Company in connection with your use of the Software on any Device. The Software may also permit you to rent Space directly to others, but these Storage Sharing Terms will not apply to those transactions. If you never rent any Space to Company, only Sections 1 and 2 of these Storage Sharing Terms will apply to you.</p>
            <p>Please refer to our <ext-a href="https://storj.io/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</ext-a> for information about how we collect, use and disclose information about you.</p>
            <p>You and Company agree as follows:</p>

            <li><h4 id="agreement-process">Agreement Process</h4>
            <p>In connection with your initial use of the Software, Company may provide notice of, and require you to affirm your agreement to, these Storage Sharing Terms.

            <p>(c) When renting out Space to Company, you will ensure that (i) your Devices at all times meet any performance levels indicated in the Software documentation or instructions, (ii) your Devices will at all times be connected to the Internet to enable Company and its users to store and access the Storage Materials with 24x7 availability, and (iii) the use of the Internet by your Devices is not excessive so as to create network congestion or other form of Internet connectivity degradation.</p>
            <p>(c) By running the Software on your Devices and allowing Space to be utilized by Company and its users, you understand that your Devices may be impacted due to the additional constraints being placed on them by the Software and the processing of Storage Materials. In particular, your Devices may not operate as quickly as they would without running the Software and making Space available for others to utilize.</p>
            <p>(d) In connection with your performance under these Storage Sharing Terms, you will comply with all applicable laws and third-party agreements to which you are bound.</p>

            </li>
            <li><h4 id="compensation">Compensation</h4>
            <p>(a) Subject to these Storage Sharing Terms, Company will pay you based upon the amount of Space utilized by Company and users of its Storage Services and the prices you have designated for such Space via the Software (“Storage Fees”). We will pay the Storage Fees in one or more of the following, in our discretion: (i) Company’s proprietary token, called STORJ; (ii) Bitcoin (BTC); or (iii) U.S. dollars.</p>
            <p>(b) You represent and warrant that you are authorized to receive the Storage Fees in any payment method you designate via the Software that is acceptable to us (“Payment Method”). If your Payment Method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your right to receive payment of the Storage Fees may be suspended automatically.</p>

Instead, you and Company will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4 id="no-class-arbitrations-class-actions-or-representative-actions">No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</h4>

Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4 id="federal-arbitration-act">Federal Arbitration Act</h4>
            <p>These Storage Sharing Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 15 will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “<strong>FAA</strong>”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4 id="notice-informal-dispute-resolution">Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</h4>
            <p>Each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Company will be sent by e-mail to Company at hello@storj.io. Notice to you will be by email to any email address you have provided to us. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 15, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 15.1, file a claim in court.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4 id="process">Process</h4>
            <p>Any arbitration will occur in New Castle County, Delaware. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference. The state and federal courts located in New Castle County, Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4 id="authority-of-arbitrator">Authority of Arbitrator</h4>
            <p>As limited by the FAA, these Storage Sharing Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Storage Sharing Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual&#39;s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h4 id="rules-of-jams">Rules of JAMS</h4>
            <p>The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the <ext-a href="www.jamsadr.com/">JAMS website</ext-a>. By agreeing to be bound by these Storage Sharing Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>

            <p>These Storage Sharing Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the parties arising out or relating to these Storage Sharing Terms that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware and the United States, respectively, sitting in New Castle County, Delaware.</p>
            </li>
