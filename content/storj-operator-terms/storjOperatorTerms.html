                14.1. <u>Governing Law; Venue</u>. This Agreement and any disputes arising under it will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws provisions, and each party consents to the

                14.2. <u>Informal Dispute Resolution</u>; Arbitration. The parties agree that most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute directly through
                consultation with each other before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. If, after good faith negotiations the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, the parties agree that any and all disputes arising out of or in any
                way relating to this Agreement, including without limitation its existence, validity or termination, shall be resolved according to Delaware law and exclusively by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator with the
                Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (JAMS) and pursuant to the then existing arbitration rules at JAMS. If the parties cannot agree upon selection of an arbitrator, then JAMS shall appoint an arbitrator experienced in
                the enterprise software industry. The place of the arbitration will be Fulton County, Georgia unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The arbitration will be conducted in English. The arbitrator shall provide detailed
                written findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of any award. Judgment upon any such award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted
                in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator
                determines that the class action waiver set forth herein is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the portions of this Section mandating arbitration shall be deemed
                null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief as set forth in Section 11.3
                (“Equitable Relief”) above and to stop unauthorized use of the Storage Node Software or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights. Disputes, claims, or controversies concerning either party’s Intellectual Property Rights
                or claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Storage Node Software or Storage Node Operator Service shall not be subject to arbitration. The parties further agree that the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to
                enforce any right or provisions under this Agreement, including any arbitration or court proceedings, will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees.
