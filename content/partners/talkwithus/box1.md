  Storj actively works with our partners to create and build sustainable revenue
  streams to support their open-source projects.  The Open-Source Partner
  Program takes your referred users who have integrated a partner-specific
  connector, and then shares revenue for any data and bandwidth that user is
  billed for.  This program is a perfect fit for open-source applications that
  have a need for embedded storage but rely on end users to procure third-party
  cloud storage.
