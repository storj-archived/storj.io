Great news! If you’re using Windows Home, you can now run a Storage Node using our native Windows installer. The new installer includes an auto-updater so you never have to worry about whether or not your Node is up to date and it also includes our brand new Node Dashboard. The Node Dashboard can be viewed in your web browser, and it provides a ton of useful information about your Node’s performance (including your reputation). 

If you want to learn a bit more about the Node Dashboard, [this article](https://storj.io/blog/2019/09/introducing-the-storage-node-operator-dashboard/) has all the specifics.

We really can’t wait for everyone who’s been waiting for the Windows update to get their Node up and running. Our Node Operators are the future of the decentralized cloud, and we couldn’t build our network without your help. 

If you don’t have an auth token, or would like one so you can join the network, click [here](https://storj.io/sign-up-node-operator/) and we’ll send you an invite shortly, along with instructions on setting up your storage node.

As always, if you have questions or need help feel free to contact us at support@storj.io or visit forum.storj.io.
