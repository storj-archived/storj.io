heading: "We Value Diversity"
subheading: "Research shows applicants who are women, non-binary, and people of color, are less likely to apply for roles that don’t precisely fit their list of qualifications. If you see an open position that interests you, please apply! We value employees because of their differences and unique viewpoints. No candidate will likely be a perfect fit for every criteria. Even if your skillset doesn’t match our job description, take a leap, and tell us what you’ll bring to the table."
description: "We continually work to improve inclusiveness ensuring opportunity, career advancement, wage equity, and access are available to everyone, no matter their background. We value diversity in every form and strive to hire the most qualified people. Storj Labs also has a Diversity and Inclusion Council to promote a culture of mutual respect and intersectional equality."
