<p>This Privacy Policy describes the data protection practices of Storj Labs Inc. and its affiliate, Storj Labs International SEZC (together referred to as “<b>Storj</b>” “<b>we</b>,” “<b>us</b>,” or “<b>our</b>”). This Privacy Policy applies to all websites owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy (the “<b>Sites</b>”), Storj’s online storage services and applications, and related online and offline services (collectively, the “<b>Services</b>”). The Services enable users to store data on third-party devices that have installed an open source, distributed storage software (“<b>Software</b>”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information other devices that have installed the Software may collect about you or your device in connection with your use of the Software. For details about the information these other devices may collect about you or your device, please see this <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://storj.io/storj-share-information/">help page</a>.</p>
<p>Storj is a platform and service provider that provides decentralized cloud storage by connecting those seeking to store data (“<b>Users</b>”) with those providing space for cloud storage (“<b>Storage Node Operators</b>”) (the “<b>Storage Services</b>”).  </p>
<p>Data submitted by Users to the Services for storage with Storage Node Operators (“<b>Storage Materials</b>”) is encrypted, which prevents Storj and Storage Node Operators from accessing the content of the Storage Materials. Storj acts as a service provider/processor of Storage Materials on behalf of its Users. Individuals whose data may be included in Storage Materials ultimately are subject to the privacy policies and practices of the User utilizing Storj for Storage Services. Accordingly, for the purposes of the European Union (“<b>EU</b>”) General Data Protection Regulation (“<b>GDPR</b>”), Users act as the data controller with respect to the processing of the Storage Materials. Storj is not responsible for the privacy practices of Users. Storj acts as the data controller and not a processor/service provider when, for example, Users, Storage Node Operators, and other Site visitors provide Storj with information, such as contact, account, and registration information.</p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION. By using the Services, you expressly and voluntarily are accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (and other applicable agreements, such as the Tardigrade Terms of Service, and Storage Node Operator Terms and Conditions) (collectively, “<b>Agreements</b>”) that allow us to process information about you.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy contains the following sections:</p>

<b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Collection of Information</b>
<u> Information You Provide to Use</u>
<p>We collect information you provide directly to us.

Types of information we may collect include, but are not limited to, telemetry data, your digital wallet address, email address, username and password, survey responses, and any other information you choose to provide</p>
<p>If you are a User or otherwise use our Storage Services, a third-party service provider may collect your payment method information for use in connection with your payments for storage.</p>
<p>If you are a Storage Node Operator, we may require you to submit a tax form in connection with your receipt of payments from us. The tax form may require you to provide certain information, including your name, business name, address, and tax identification number (e.g., SSN or EIN). We will use this tax form information solely to submit relevant tax filings.</p>

<u>Notice About Use of our Public Forums and Features</u>
<p>Certain features of our Services make it possible for you to share comments publicly with others, such as through our public forums, blogs and message boards. You should be aware that any information you provide or post in these ways may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.  We encourage you to be cautious about the information you submit (e.g., choose a username that does not disclose your personal identity).  Whenever you post something publicly, it may be impossible to remove all instances of the posted information, for example, if someone has taken a screenshot of your posting.</p>
<u>Social Sharing Features</u>
<p>Our Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your contacts or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.</p>
<p><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cookies and Online Analytics</b></p>
<p>We use a variety of online tracking and analytics tools (e.g., cookies, pixel tags, and HTML5) to collect and analyze information as you use the Services. Among other things, these technologies allow us to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing and usage preferences. </p>
<p>We may also use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics, Coremetrics, Mixpanel, and Segment) on our Services to collect and analyze information collected through these technologies to assist us in auditing, research, or reporting; fraud prevention; and, providing certain features to you.  The types of tracking and analytics tools we and our service providers use for these purposes are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>“Cookies” are small data files stored on your computer or device to collect information about your use of the Services. Cookies may enable us to recognize you as the same user who used our Services in the past, and relate your use of the Services to other information we have about you. Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Services (for example, by storing your username) and/or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information. Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, limit your use of our Services or features. To learn more about the use of cookies, including how to manage or delete them, click <a target="_blank" href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/" class="link">here</a>.  Please note that by blocking, disabling, or managing any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services. </li></p>
	<li><p>“Local shared objects,” or “flash cookies,” may be stored on your computer or device using a media player or other software. Local shared objects operate much like cookies, but cannot be managed in the same way. Depending on how local shared objects are enabled on your computer or device, you may be able to manage them using software settings. For information on managing flash cookies, for example, click <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118">here</a>.</li></p>
	<li><p>A “pixel tag” (also known as a “<b>clear GIF</b>” or “<b>web beacon</b>”) is a tiny image – typically just one-pixel – that can be placed on a web page or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether you’ve opened one of our emails or seen one of our web pages.</p></li>
	<p>
		<b>Do Not Track</b>. Do Not Track (“<b>DNT</b>”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for online advertising and analytics purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. Learn more about <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" class="link" target="_blank">Do Not Track</a>.
	</p>
</ul>
<b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aggregate/De-Identified Information</b>
<p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Services so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device (“<b>Aggregate/De-Identified Information</b>”). We may use Aggregate/De-Identified Information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with third parties, including advertisers, promotional partners, and sponsors, in our discretion.</p>
<b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Choices and Rights</b>
<p>You have certain rights with respect to your information as further described in this Section, in addition to rights discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. Please note your rights and choices vary depending upon your location.</p>
<p><b>Marketing Communications</b>. You can instruct us not to use your information to contact you by email, postal mail, or phone regarding products, services, promotions, and special events that may appeal to your interests by contacting us using the information below. You may do so in commercial email messages by following the instructions located at the bottom of such emails. Removing your name from the email list may take a reasonable amount of time. Please note that, regardless of your request, we may still use and share certain information as permitted by this Privacy Policy or as required by applicable law. For example, you may not opt out of certain operational emails, such as those reflecting our relationship or transactions with you.</p>
<p><b>Account information.</b> We encourage you to periodically review and update your settings and profile information by logging into your account.</p>
<p>Telemetry Information. Users of the Software can opt out of our collection of Telemetry Information. Please refer to the settings area of the Software to opt out of this collection.</p>

<u>Personal Data Transfers Outside of the EEA</u>
<p>Storj may transfer some of your personal information outside of the EEA. Storj may transmit some of your personal information to a country where the data protection laws may not provide a level of protection equivalent to the laws in your jurisdiction, including the United States. As required by applicable law, Storj will provide an adequate level of protection for your personal data using various means, including, where appropriate:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>relying on a formal decision by the European Commission that a certain country ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data (a full list of such decisions may be accessed online <a target="_blank class="link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm">here</a>.</li></p>
	<li><p>entering into appropriate data transfer agreements based on language approved by the European Commission, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses (2010/87/EC and/or 2004/915/EC), which are available upon request at <a href="mailto:legal@storj.io">legal@storj.io;</a></li></p>
	<li><p>implementing appropriate physical, technical, and organizational security measures to protect personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against unlawful forms of processing; and</li></p>
	<li><p>taking other measures to provide an adequate level of data protection in accordance with applicable law.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>Any onward transfer is subject to appropriate onward transfer requirements as required by applicable law.</p>
<u>Data Subject Rights</u>
<p>If you are an EEA resident, you may have a right to request from Storj access to and rectification or erasure of your personal data or restriction of processing concerning you, as well as the right to data portability under the GDPR. You also have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal data by us and we can be required to no longer process your personal data. In general, you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. If you have a right to object and you exercise this right, your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes by us. You can exercise such rights by accessing the information in your account or by filling out the <a href="https://support.storj.io/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000793912" class="link" target="_blank">GDPR Data Subject Rights Webform</a>.</p>
<p>Please also note that Storage Materials are encrypted, which prevents Storj and Storage Node Operators from accessing the information. Those who wish to access or delete any personal information within Storage Materials must direct their queries to the relevant User.</p>
<p>If you have provided consent for cookies that are not strictly necessary, direct marketing emails or other data processing, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing or other activity based on consent before you withdraw it. You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>
<p><b>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Information for California Residents</b></p>
<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“<b>CCPA</b>”) applies to certain companies based on thresholds set in the law. The CCPA applies to companies that meet at least one of the following: minimum annual gross revenue of $25M; collects the personal information of at least 50,000 “consumers” (as defined under the law), households, or devices; or, derives at least 50% of its revenue from the sale of consumers’ personal information.  None of these currently apply to Storj.  Companies that are subject to the CCPA, however, must provide California residents with some additional information regarding the collection, use, and sharing of “personal information” as defined in the CCPA.  Although Storj currently is not subject to the CCPA, we voluntarily are providing certain additional information below for informational purposes only, :

<u>Your California Privacy Rights</u>
<p>If the CCPA were applicable to Storj, the CCPA would require us to provide certain information to California residents upon request. Specifically, the CCPA would allow California residents to request us to:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Inform them about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about them; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting their personal information; and, the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information. </li></p>
	<li><p>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about them.</li></p>
	<li><p>Delete certain personal information we have about them.</li></p>
	<li><p>Provide them with information about the financial incentives that we offer to them, if any.</li></p>
</ul>
<p>
	The CCPA exempts certain information from some requests including, for example, a company may need certain information to provide the requested services or to comply with a legal obligation.  In some circumstances if the consumer still asks for their information to be deleted, they may no longer be able to access or use the services offered.  Notwithstanding, the CCPA protects a person making a request under the law to be free from discrimination for exercising their rights.
</p>
<p>Companies subject to the CCPA should take reasonable steps to verify the consumer’s identity before responding to a request, including by asking for verification information to match at least two verification points with information already on file. If the consumer can’t be verified this way, a company has the right, but not the obligation, to request additional information from the consumer. The CCPA also permits consumers to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on their behalf.  The authorized agent must have signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney, and may be subject to additional verification before the authorized agent’s request is processed </p>
<p>As noted above, Storage Materials are encrypted, which prevents Storj and Storage Node Operators from accessing the encrypted data. If the CCPA applies, any person who wishes to access or delete personal information within Storage Materials must send their queries to the relevant User.</p>
<u>California “Shine the Light” Disclosure</u>
<p>The California “Shine the Light” law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to opt out of the sharing of certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  Storj’s policy and practice is to never share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  Accordingly, there is no need for Storj consumers to opt out.</p>
<b>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Information for Nevada Residents</b>
<p>Under Nevada law, certain Nevada residents may opt out of the “sale” of “covered information” (as those terms are defined under Nevada law) where the sale allows the person buying it to license or sell such information to additional persons. “Covered information” includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, social security number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online.</p>
<p>Storj does not sell consumer information as defined under Nevada law.     Notwithstanding, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased or leased goods or services from us, Nevada law permits you to submit a request to opt out of the sale of your covered information.  To do so, you may email your request to <a href="mailto:nevadarequests@storj.io">nevadarequests@storj.io</a>. Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.</p>
